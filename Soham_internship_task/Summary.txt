Approach:


    1) Data preprocessing 
    2) finding  and handling null values (done in preprocessing.ipynb file)
 
 
1)Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load your dataset using pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv').
Apply label encoding to 'Gender' and 'Location' columns to convert them into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
Define your feature matrix X and the target variable y.
Standardize the numerical features using StandardScaler.

2)Data Splitting:
Split your data into training and testing sets using train_test_split to have a portion of data reserved for model evaluation.
Logistic Regression Model:

Initialize a logistic regression model using LogisticRegression().
Use cross-validation (cross_val_score) to assess the model's accuracy.
Calculate the mean accuracy over the cross-validation folds.

3)Random Forest Model:
Initialize a random forest classifier using RandomForestClassifier().
Use cross-validation to assess the random forest model's accuracy.
Calculate the mean accuracy over the cross-validation folds.

4)Neural Network Model:
Define a simple neural network architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
Compile the model with the appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Use StratifiedKFold for cross-validation.
Train the neural network on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size.
Evaluate the model on the validation set.
Calculate the mean accuracy over the cross-validation folds.

5)Model Comparison:
Compare the accuracies of the three models.
Determine the best model based on the highest accuracy.

6)Final Model Selection:
The best model is the one with the highest accuracy among logistic regression, random forest, and the neural network.

7)Model Tuning and Optimization:
Depending on the performance, you may need to tune hyperparameters, adjust the neural network architecture, or apply feature engineering techniques to further improve the model.

8)Use the Best Model for Prediction:
Once you've determined the best model, you can use it to make predictions on new data to predict churn.
